## 🧪 3. Getting Started as a QA Contributor

If you enjoy testing, quality assurance, or helping ensure stable releases — this is for you!

**How to begin:**

1. Join the **#qa-testing** channel on Discord.
2. Download the latest pre-release or nightly build.
3. Test new or updated features against the release checklist.
4. Report issues clearly on GitHub — include steps, screenshots, and environment details.
5. Optionally, write automated test scripts or help expand regression coverage.

**Good starting points:**

-   Verify bug fixes labeled `needs testing`.
-   Validate that new tools integrate cleanly with the main app.
-   Test UI consistency and edge cases (permissions, offline, etc.).
-   Document any test cases you create under `/tests` or `/docs/tests`.
